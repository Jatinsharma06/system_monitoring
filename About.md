System Monitoring: Disk space, CPU, memory usage, etc.
System monitoring is the process of continuously observing and analyzing the performance, health, and availability of critical system components such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and network. It ensures that the system operates efficiently, identifies potential bottlenecks, and helps detect issues before they impact operations.  

By leveraging tools and scripts for system monitoring, IT administrators and engineers can:  
- Track **CPU utilization** to prevent performance degradation.  
- Monitor **memory usage** to ensure efficient application performance.  
- Analyze **disk usage** to avoid storage capacity issues.  
- Review **system uptime** to measure reliability and availability.  
- Identify resource-intensive processes for optimization.  

Effective system monitoring is a crucial component of infrastructure management, enabling proactive maintenance, improved system stability, and optimal resource allocation. It is particularly critical in environments requiring high availability, such as cloud platforms and production servers.
